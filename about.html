    <div id="body1">
      <p>I've held a love of Cooking for years, from working in restaurants to helping out with communal meals for family and friends.<br>I can recall fond memories of helping my mother with home baking, as well as preparing food for the Street Parties organised for the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002.</p>

      <br><p>I've let this fascination drag me across the Globe. From authentic 火锅 in China, to being offered Surströmming in Sweden. I've enjoyed meals with strangers who became friends, and friends who became family.<br> Before the Pandemic shoved a hypothetical Rebar through the Bicycle wheels of ambition and international travel, I was planning a 3 month round trip through India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in a quest to find new flavours and explore the subcontinent.</p>

      <p>With these experiences and cuisines fresh in my mind, I spent a chunk of my early 20's working in Kitchens for a variety of restaurants, typically working as a Production Line Chef's assistant, with room to experiment and collaborate with peers and colleagues.<br>
